Description: 
    This package retrieves new applicant records from tne NPower Salesforce database, 
    assigns each one to treatment or control with a probability calculated on the basis 
    of their demographic characteristics. 
    As it is used, it tracks activity in various text files on google drive.
    These logs are designed to be used within the package, as persistent records of
    the assignemnts used, applicant ids assigned, for analysis and triage of 
    demographic balance between experiment groups, and for methodological audit. 
    Building this functionality as a package with a linked cloud data store serves
    to enable visibility and collaboration within and outside of the Blueprint team, 
    while establishing a reusable standard for implementing random assignment on our
    projects in the future.
